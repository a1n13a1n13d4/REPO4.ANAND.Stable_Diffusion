## About Project

Stable Diffusion AI is a cutting-edge machine learning model that leverages diffusion processes for generating images. It has been designed to provide high-quality, high-resolution images while being computationally efficient.

**Note:** This is an open-source project that I use and run as part of my internship. The project is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and contribute to.

I used the [AUTOMATIC1111's stable-diffusion-webui repository](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui) as a base and updated the UI to feature a **Black Theme** for a more modern and visually appealing interface.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

To clone the repository, run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anandsundaramoorthysa/REPO4.ANAND.Stable_Diffusion.git
cd REPO4.ANAND.Stable_Diffusion
```

### Step 2: Run `webui.bat` (With Internet Connection)

Run the `webui.bat` script to automatically install all required dependencies and set up the necessary files, models, and interfaces. Ensure you have a stable **internet connection**:

```bash
webui.bat
```

This will handle the entire setup process, including downloading the necessary models, installing dependencies, and starting the interface.

> **Important**: Make sure **Python 3.10.6** is installed before running the web UI.

## Use/Run the Project

Once the setup is complete, you can start the project by running the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will initialize the model and begin the image generation process.

## Features

- **High-Quality Image Generation**: Generate realistic images with impressive details.
- **Efficient Computation**: Optimized for speed and resource usage.
- **Customizable UI**: Updated with a **Black Theme** for an improved user experience.
- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize the model settings to suit various use cases.
